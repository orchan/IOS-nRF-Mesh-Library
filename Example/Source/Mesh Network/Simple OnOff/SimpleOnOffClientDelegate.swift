/// This is an implementation of a simple Vendor Model defined in nRF Mesh SDK from
/// Nordic Semiconductor.
///
/// The Simple OnOff Client model can send 3 types of messages:
/// - 0x01 - Simple OnOff Set
/// - 0x02 - Simple OnOff Get
/// - 0x03 - Simple OnOff Set Unacknowledged
///
/// and it can receive one status message for Get and Set:
/// - 0x04 - Simple OnOff Status
///
/// Messages in this library are sent using the `MeshNetworkManager`, not
/// from the Model delegate.
