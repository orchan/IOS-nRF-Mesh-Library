/// Representation of a Provisioner in the mesh network.

/// A Provisioner is an entity that is able to provision other device to
/// the mesh network by assigning them Unicast Addresses and providing
/// a Network Key in a secure way. A Provisioner with a Unicast Address
/// assigned may also configure devices and becomes a Node of a network
/// on its own.
///
/// Each Provisioner has assigned 3 ranges:
/// * Unicast Address range - set of Unicast Addresses which may assign to new
///   Nodes during provisioning,
/// * Group Address range - set of Group Addresses which the Provisioner may use
///   to define new groups.
/// * Scene range - set of Scene numbers which it may use to define new scenes.
///
/// The Provisioner should not assign addresses from outside of its ranges to avoid
/// conflicts with other Provisioners.
