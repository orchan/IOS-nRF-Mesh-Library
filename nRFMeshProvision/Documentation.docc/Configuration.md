# Configuration

Configuration allows to customize the behavior of the local and remote nodes.

## Overview

Each Node has a unique, random 128-bit secret key, called a *Device Key*, assigned during provisioning.

Configuration messages are secured using this Device Key on the Access Layer. Only the Provisioner
and the configured Node, which know the key, can encrypt and decrypt such messages.

Use ``MeshNetworkManager/sendToLocalNode(_:)`` to configure the *local node*. The ``ConfigMessage``s
will be handled by the *Configuration Server* model automaticaly by the library.

To configure the remote nodes, use ``MeshNetworkManager/send(_:to:withTtl:)-77r3r``.

Status messages for configuration messages are delivered using
``MeshNetworkDelegate/meshNetworkManager(_:didReceiveMessage:sentFrom:to:)`` to the 
``MeshNetworkManager/delegate``.

The updated state of the mesh network is automaticaly saved in the ``Storage``. 

> Important: As the nRF Mesh library supports *Configuration Server* model, it also allows 
             other provisioners to remotely reconfigure the *local node* when it is connected to a Proxy node.
             For example, the phone can be remotely removed from network. To avoid that, do not 
             share the Device Key of the local node when exporting network configuration.
